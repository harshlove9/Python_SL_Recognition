Abstract: Deaf and dumb people communicate among themselves using sign language but normal people find it difficult to know their language. The basic step is bridging the                   communication gap between normal people and deaf and dumb people using English alphabet sign language. Using English alphabet sign language, the deaf and dumb                  people communicate faster and easy to understand. To recognition English alphabet sign language recognition using deep neural network is a classical problem in deep            learning.Conventional tools used for sign language translation involves application of linear classifiers such as KNN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform the           classification of images. But these methods require more features for classification. To automate the feature extraction procedure a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is              used with the use of feature extraction and convolution neural network algorithm are more effective approach of English alphabet sign language recognition. English               alphabet sign language recognition is identified using Deep Learning (DL) approach.
       

AIM:  Sign language interpreters remove language barriers between people who are deaf and use Sign Language and people who can hear and speak. The main goal is to develop an
      approach for real time sign language recognition for English alphabet.
       
       
Objective: • To develop a sign language recognition system with the help of image processing techniques.
           • To improve accuracy Using English sign language recognition.
           • Focus on English alphabet sign language alphabet(A-Z).
           
PROBLEM STATEMENT: English alphabet sign recognition is not new deep learning problem. Over the past two decades there are so many classifiers used from a variety of categories                    that we can group roughly into neural network. The most significant advantage of neural networks is that they learn the most important classification                           features.However, they require considerably more time and data to train. But there is a no real time detection is available and lack of accuracy in English                      alphabet sign language recognition.

Dataset:  Images of hand signals for English alphabet Sign Language (EASL) are gotten from the Kaggle website [37]. The dataset comprises shading pictures of sign signals                 speaking to English letters in order and extra images, for example, space,del and nothing. Right now, the pictures of 29 English images and space are chosen                     for preparing the  proposed sign gester recognition. The sign motion pictures are put away in a different envelope for preparing and approval.An                                 aggregate of 2464 pictures for the ESL is   utilized for the preparation of the DNN(Deep Neural Network).
  

CONCLUSION: A deep neural network-based English Sign Language detection based on hand gestures images are designed and validated in this paper. The work analyses a three-layer              convolution network with batch normalization for hand gesture detection. Deep neural network for English alphabet sign language recognition is the feature                     vector which including whole images containing all the aspects of the sign considered. Using deep neural network, the accuracy is effectively for English alphabet               sign language recognition. In future work, there are some alphabet sample is not accurate. So, increase the accuracy of its alphabet. English alphabet sign language            recognition requires more number of convolution block and try different optimizer method for effective accuracy of sign language.
