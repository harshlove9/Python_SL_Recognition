Abstract: Deaf and dumb people communicate among themselves using sign language but normal people find it difficult to know their language. The basic step is bridging the                   communication gap between normal people and deaf and dumb people using English alphabet sign language. Using English alphabet sign language, the deaf and dumb                  people communicate faster and easy to understand. To recognition English alphabet sign language recognition using deep neural network is a classical problem in deep            learning.Conventional tools used for sign language translation involves application of linear classifiers such as KNN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform the           classification of images. But these methods require more features for classification. To automate the feature extraction procedure a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is              used with the use of feature extraction and convolution neural network algorithm are more effective approach of English alphabet sign language recognition. English               alphabet sign language recognition is identified using Deep Learning (DL) approach.
       

AIM:  Sign language interpreters remove language barriers between people who are deaf and use Sign Language and people who can hear and speak. The main goal is to develop an
      approach for real time sign language recognition for English alphabet.
