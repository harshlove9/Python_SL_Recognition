Abstract: Deaf and dumb people communicate among themselves using sign language but normal people find it difficult to know their
language. The basic step is bridging the communication gap between normal people and deaf and dumb people using English alphabet
sign language. Using English alphabet sign language, the deaf and dumb people communicate faster and easy to understand. To
recognition English alphabet sign language recognition using deep neural network is a classical problem in deep learning. Conventional
tools used for sign language translation involves application of linear classifiers such as KNN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
perform the classification of images. But these methods require more features for classification. To automate the feature extraction
procedure a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used. In this paper, with the use of feature extraction and convolution neural network
algorithm are more effective approach of English alphabet sign language recognition. English alphabet sign language recognition is
identified using Deep Learning (DL) approach.
